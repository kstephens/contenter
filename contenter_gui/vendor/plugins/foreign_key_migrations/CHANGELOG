[REVISION 20080131]

[FIXED] Stack-level too deep.

[NEW] Generate foreign keys for databases that currently have none. Doesn't check to see if the foreign key already exists, nor does it drop the foreign keys yet.

[REVISION 20071128]

[FIXED] Workaround to ensure plugin is only ever loaded once.

[REVISION 20070905]

[FIXED] "some_column_name" referenced in foreign key constraint does not exist.

[REVISION 20070904]

[NEW] Support :references keyword when calling primary_key().

[NEW] [#11995] the parameter :references needs the second argument referencing the field name.

[REVISION 20070707]

[NEW] Support acts_as_tree convention: if a column is named parent_id it will be treated as a circular reference to the table in which it is defined.

[REVISION 20070703]

[FIXED] Foreign-keys not created when using add_column.

[REVISION 20070628]

[FIXED] Stack level too deep in 'add_column_without_foreign_key_migrations' (Ronen Barzel).

[REVISION 20070503]

[NEW] Support for SQL92 [NOT] DEFERRABLE on foreign keys.

[REVISION 20061202]

[CHANGED] Use Rails 1.2 alias_method_chain.

[CHANGED] Separate modules into individual files.

[REVISION 20061013]

[NEW] install.rb informs user of missing dependencies.

[REVISION 20060909]

[CHANGED] Replaced dependence on defunct Foreign Key Support and Schema Defining plugins with a single dependece on RedHill on Rails Core.

[REVISION 20060831]

[CHANGED] Separated out generic foreign-key functionality into new foreign key support plugin.

[REVISION 20060629]

[NEW] Added foreign_key method to table to allow t.foreign_key(columns, references_table_name, references_column_names, options).

[NEW] Support foreign keys in add_column as we do for initial table columns.

[NEW] Support :on_update and :on_delete as options--with values of :set_null, :cascade, or :restrict--for all foreign key creation mechanisms.

[REVISION 20060627]

[CHANGED] Reverted to overloaded column method with optional :references as the preferred mechanism with belongs_to a "nicety". This is really as a result of using it in a large-scale production application where belongs_to just didn't feel right in many cases and was semantically ambiguous.

[REVISION 20060824]

[CHANGED] Replaced method and column option :references with :belongs_to in keeping with the rails model keywords. The references variations are still available but have been deprecated and will be removed.

[NEW] Added options :dependent => :nullify to SET NULL or :dependent => :delete_all | :destroy to CASCADE DELETE.

[REVISION 20060812]

[NEW] Added new table method references(table, options) which is essentially an alias for column(:table_id, :integer, options).

[REVISION 20060803]

[FIXED] The method proper_pluralized_table_name tries to call pluralize_table_name where it should call pluralized_table_name.

[REVISION 20060623]

[FIXED] Another try at a hack-around for a "feature" of pluralize that when called to pluralize a word that is already in the plural, acts as singularize.

[REVISION 20060616]

[FIXED] Hack-around for a "feature" of pluralize that when called to pluralize a word that is already in the plural, acts as singularize. Ie. "countries".pluralize becomes "country"!

[REVISION 200606004]

[CHANGED] This plugin now depends on Schema Defining!

[REVISION 20060602]

[CHANGED] Simplified static method overriding thanks to Ryan Tomayko.

[REVISION 20060525]

[CHANGED] Disabled foreign-key generation when executing a schema dump. This is a temporary measure until I get around to batching up the foreign keys at the end of the script.

[REVISION 20060523]

[NEW] Support :references => nil to prevent unwanted foreign-keys.

[FIXED] Pluralization.

[REVISION 20060522]

[FIXED] Infinite recursion caused by bug in 1.8.4 method_alias on windows.
