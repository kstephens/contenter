# File:    global_vs_specific.yml
# Purpose: A demonstration file for different types of content change scenarios
#          demoed via in-place edit of contenter.yml
#
# NOTE!! You do not want to normally do an in-place-edit of contenter.yml 
# because it will then require you to sync up with cms.cashnetusa.com so that
# the next download from the CMS contains the changes you just made
